Over the past several months, I have become acutely aware of my inability to focus. I don't have any kind of diagnosed problem, though. The root cause is this: I have an smartphone. Our increasingly technological world has conditioned our brains to take in tiny bits of information about all kinds of topics at extremely fast rates. We're always looking for the next post, the next headline, the next episode, or the next notification to keep us interested and engaged. As a result, our ability to focus on a single task for a long period of time is nearly extinct. We have forgotten how to do hard, [deep work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/). Personally, learning this was almost terrifying as my livelihood requires my focus, my attention to detail and patterns, and long periods of critical thinking. In response, I've made a point of picking up **focal practices**. Focal practices are anything that requires one-hundred percent of your attention. For me, it's been reading, baking, and puppy training.

### Reading
My library has expanded by about 50% (seeing I haven't purchased _that_ many books, that says something about the size of my collection in the first place). I have found a particular interest in texts relating to User Experience and personal growth (I cringe at the term self-help, but it's not all that far off).

### Baking
Our pantry is now stocked with all baking essentials so that when I find myself with some free time and the need to use my hands outside of a keyboard, I'm ready to go. My favorite recipe so far has been Swedish cardamom buns.

### Puppy Training
Bringing home a puppy wasn't an intentional way to add another focal practice to my life, but this one has certainly been the hardest and the most fun simultaneously.
